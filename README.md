# About
This project is an attempt to build a chess library in Rust from scratch. I will also be using a web application framework, such as [Tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide), to develop an API, and a frontend framework, such as [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew), to develop a client app.

The main goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of the Rust language, discover its features, and explore the community.

### The chess library
The actual chess library is in `/chess`, where documentation can be found.
